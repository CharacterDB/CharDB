# CharDB

CharDB is a database layout to store and study Chinese and Japanese vocabulary based on James Heisig's teachings. It links primitives and meanings only and does not replace Heisig's books.

> NOTE: Some characters are primitives only and not used in the actual language. Those primitives do not have a pronunciation.

## Current State

Currently CharDB is in a premature development state and only supports the chinese system.

### TODO:

> Here you can find flaws we need to fix that came up during development and testing but were not easy to solve immediately

 - Ensure only one keyword per character
 - Error Handling in API
 - paging in characters query
 - consistent term `transcription` replaces `pronunciation`
 - use bulk requests for better readability
