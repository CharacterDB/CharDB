# CharDB

CharDB is a database layout to store and study Chinese and Japanese vocabulary based on James Heisig's teachings. It links primitives and meanings only and does not replace Heisig's books.

> NOTE: Some characters are primitives only and not used in the actual language. Those primitives do not have a pronunciation.

## Current State

Currently CharDB is in a premature development state and only supports the chinese system.
